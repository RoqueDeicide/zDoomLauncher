A simple launcher for zDoom (and other source ports that accept zDoom-compatible command line arguments) that uses WPF for interface.

Make sure .NET 4.8 is installed.

You can: select which IWAD file to use, which PWAD, pk3 etc files to load, do a little bit of tweaking and also select which source port to use.

Status: v1.p4.
